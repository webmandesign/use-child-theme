# WebMan Design Use Child Theme

*This is a fork of [**Use Child Theme**](https://github.com/FacetWP/use-child-theme) by [**FacetWP**](https://facetwp.com/) modified for use in WebMan Design themes out of the box.*

## How It Works

* If a child theme is not active, the user will see a WP notice with an "Activate" link **on the Theme Editor screen**
* When clicked, a child theme is created (if needed) and enabled

## Development Setup

This script uses `text_domain` development variable/prefix. Search & replace the `{%= text_domain %}` to match the parent theme text domain.
